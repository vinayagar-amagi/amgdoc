# Introduction  

Amagi has been delivering linear channels to traditional broadcasters and digital TV platforms using CLOUDPORT platform. CLOUDPORT platform uses a limited set of metadata for channel playout. The requirement for content ingest has evolved to support additional services and integration with MVPD platforms. The additional services for VOD delivery and EPG required additional assets and metadata for processing as per MVPD specifications. When these services were evolving the content for these services was managed independently. With the Asset Ingest Service, we are looking to consolidate across the three services in the Amagi system by using a common store and a predefined set of asset ingest methods catering to all customer needs.

# Asset Ingest Service
This service will integrate the assets and metadata delivery from customers and unify it across a single platform, to be used across all Amagi products and offerings, as desired. Customers will have the ability to send/upload assets and metadata onto Amagiâ€™s system, track the ingest status for each asset, submit change requests via Jira tickets and receive alerts and notifications for errors or failures.
