# Asset Ingest Service

## Getting Started

This section introduces the process guidelines for Asset Ingest Service, the services provided and platforms supported. The following diagram represents a process for enabling customers to ingest assets and metadata to Amagi platforms.

## Process

### Create a new customer

* If you are a new customer, you will be added to the Asset Ingest Service by Onboarding. 
* Currently, there is no Amagi-wide customer portal service, so a new account will be created by Onboarding.
* Jira will be used for maintaining customer accounts.
* New customer account details will be sent to you upon account creation.

### Create an account
    * You can create a request in Jira to add a new account to Asset Ingest Service.
    * After creation, you will have to select an ingest method from the list of methods provided as part of the guide.
    * Based on the selected ingest method, the timeline for provisioning will be provided by the Service team.
    * Communication of the request will be facilitated through Jira. There should be a conscious effort to minimize or avoid entirely the meetings 
      to discuss requirements and workflow.
    * Jira requests can be received over email also. Jira email handler will be added to create and update Jira tickets from emails.

### Change request
    * In order to raise change requests, you can use Jira for raising tickets.
    * New account creation will also be served through Jira.
    * Change request communication will be handled through Jira tickets. Timeline for provisioning will be provided by the Service team.

### Operational Phase
    * You will be provided with an interface for ingesting assets and metadata to Amagi Asset Ingest Service without needing involvement of Amagi 
      personnel.
    * Alerts and notifications will be provided to the customer.

### Ad-hoc requests
    * No ad-hoc request to make changes is planned to be entertained during the operational phase. 
    * Amagi operationsâ€™ role is limited to Infra monitoring of the service
    * Change requests are accepted through Jira
    * In case of issues with usage, Amagi Operations will be providing guidance as per defined SOP
